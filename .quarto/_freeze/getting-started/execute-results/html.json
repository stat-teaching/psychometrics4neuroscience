It is very easy to install and you can find instructions here [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\nTo check if Quarto is installed, you can open a terminal (e.g., Powershell or CMD in Windows) and type:\n\n```bash\nquarto --version\n```\n\nThis should return the version of Quarto without errors or strange messages.\n\n## Git/Github\n\nGit is a version-control system that you can easily install from here [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). You can use Git from the command line depending on your operating system or you can use the Github Desktop software [https://desktop.github.com/download/](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to work with a GUI.\n\nGithub is the online version of Git and works as an online repository to share and store the code. In order to work with Git and Github you need to:\n\n- create an account [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)\n- configure your local machine with an SSH key (with this you do not need to write the password every time). Configuring an SSH key is not so easy thus I suggest you to use the Github CLI tool [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/) where you can configure your account using SSH very easily. The instructions can be found here [https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login) and we need to use the `gh auth login` command.\n\nAlso here you can check the Git installation typing this command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit --version\n```\n\n## Cloning the repository\n\nNow that we have all the tools we can clone the repository of the course. You can navigate into the folder that you want in your machine and type:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:stat-teaching/psychometrics4neuroscience.git\n```\nOr manually (but there will not be the Git-Github link) downloading the zip folder from [https://github.com/stat-teaching/psychometrics4neuroscience](https://github.com/stat-teaching/psychometrics4neuroscience).\n\nIf you cloned the repository you can navigate into the folder and type:\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\nThis should return some info or messages not errors or messages related to non being in a Git repository.\n\nNow you have the repository of the course. I will update this repository during the course with new slides and materials. \n\nDo not modify the files and everytime you start working or using this repository run:\n\n```bash\ngit pull\n```\n\nAnd your local repository will be updated.\n\n## Creating your repository\n\nFor the course exercises, notes and everything else, I suggest you to create a local folder to track with Git and Github. Follow these steps:\n\n- create an R Project\n- create an R/ folder\n- init the git repository with the command `git init`\n- add all files with `git add .`\n- commit the changes with `git commit -m \"message\"`\n\nThen you need to create and link the online repository. Go to Github and create a new empty repository. Copy the SSH address and run `git remote add origin <ssh link>`. Then run `git push`. In this way your local and online Git repositories will be linked.\n\nCheck these other resources to learn Git:\n\n- [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)\n- [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)",
