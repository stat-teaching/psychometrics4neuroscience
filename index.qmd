There are few tools that we need to install and configure for the course.

- **R/Rstudio (or another IDE)**
- **Quarto**
- **Git/Github**

## Quarto

Quarto is an an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It is very easy to install and you can find instructions here [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

To check if Quarto is installed, you can open a terminal (e.g., Powershell or CMD in Windows) and type:

```bash
quarto --version
```

This should return the version of Quarto without errors or strange messages.

## Git/Github

Git is a version-control system that you can easily install from here [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). You can use Git from the command line depending on your operating system or you can use the Github Desktop software [https://desktop.github.com/download/](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to work with a GUI.

Github is the online version of Git and works as an online repository to share and store the code. In order to work with Git and Github you need to:

- create an account [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
- configure your local machine with an SSH key (with this you do not need to write the password every time). Configuring an SSH key is not so easy thus I suggest you to use the Github CLI tool [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/) where you can configure your account using SSH very easily. The instructions can be found here [https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login) and we need to use the `gh auth login` command.

Also here you can check the Git installation typing this command in the terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

## Cloning the repository

Now that we have all the tools we can clone the repository of the course. You can navigate into the folder that you want in your machine and type:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stat-teaching/psychometrics4neuroscience.git
```
Or manually (but there will not be the Git-Github link) downloading the zip folder from [https://github.com/stat-teaching/psychometrics4neuroscience](https://github.com/stat-teaching/psychometrics4neuroscience).

If you cloned the repository you can navigate into the folder and type:

```bash
git status
```

This should return some info or messages not errors or messages related to non being in a Git repository.

Now you have the repository of the course. I will update this repository during the course with new slides and materials. 

Do not modify the files and everytime you start working or using this repository run:

```bash
git pull
```

And your local repository will be updated.

## Creating your repository

For the course exercises, notes and everything else, I suggest you to create a local folder to track with Git and Github. Follow these steps:

- create an R Project
- create an R/ folder
- init the git repository with the command `git init`
- add all files with `git add .`
- commit the changes with `git commit -m "message"`

Then you need to create and link the online repository. Go to Github and create a new empty repository. Copy the SSH address and run `git remote add origin <ssh link>`. Then run `git push`. In this way your local and online Git repositories will be linked.
